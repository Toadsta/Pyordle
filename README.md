# Pyordle


Pyorlde is a version of the hit game Worlde in python. I made this to try and learn some new stuff such as using API requests
## How to run the game?
Simple! Download this project and then run the main.py
- I will give more instructions later
## Whats next?
- User validation (check if it's an actual word)
- A GUI (maybe)
- Fix the issue that if a letter is in sentence once, but in the users guess it's there twice it prints to the console it's in the word twice
- Create 2 modes, a daily mode like the current Wordle, and what I have implemented now, newly generated words after each previous game
- There is also a way to make use any size word, I will implement this more in the future, right now its hard coded in the game
